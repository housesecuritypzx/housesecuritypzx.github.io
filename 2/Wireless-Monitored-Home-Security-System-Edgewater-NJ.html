<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that stores it on a hard drive for later retrieval.
