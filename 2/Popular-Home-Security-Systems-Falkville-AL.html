<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you might want to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases suited everyday objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When it pertains to innovation, reliability is a highly subjective matter, depending on which features and advantages a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common grievances. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and short of a general power outage, are harder to interfere with. In spite of a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer methods for hardwired systems to be disrupted and disabled. </p>
