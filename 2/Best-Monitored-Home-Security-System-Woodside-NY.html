<p>During our screening, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We specifically like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of view, since you're less most likely to get a blind area anywhere you set it up.

In the last number of years, the company started offering additional security services like modern-day, easy-to-use equipment, which incorporate well and uses smart home compatibility.</p>
<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the porch by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey however is essential. In truth, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and a car, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
