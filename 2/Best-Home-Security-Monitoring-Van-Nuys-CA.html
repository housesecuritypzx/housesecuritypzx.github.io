Without taking the correct security preventative measures, you might be leaving your home open to burglars who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors picking up their presence.</p>

Now, most security systems include a great number of elements, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, among other components.

<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!
