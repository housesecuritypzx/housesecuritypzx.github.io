<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see a lot of growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies extensively depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
