If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
