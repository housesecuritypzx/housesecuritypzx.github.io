<p>When choosing a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other major decision. Outdoor cameras will frequently be constructed to be more long lasting and able to endure rain, frost, or damp.

Thankfully, I have actually tested out dozens of cameras and condensed whatever I have actually learned into the list listed below.

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
