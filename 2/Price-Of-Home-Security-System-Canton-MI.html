<h3>Wireless Security Alarm Systems For Home in Canton MI</h3>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
