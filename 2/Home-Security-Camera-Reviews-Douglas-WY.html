<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set quantity of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment up front offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you want.</p>
