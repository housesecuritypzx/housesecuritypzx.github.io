<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for".

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing seeing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the very same person could position a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the privacy of their home.
