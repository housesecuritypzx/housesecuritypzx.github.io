<p>You use a keypad to manually equip and deactivate your home security system. Like the majority of wireless security equipment, keypads can be installed anywhere you want. Most wireless keypads are placed by the front door, however it doesn't need to be. You might desire numerous keypads if your home has several entryways that are often used, such as one by the front door and one in the garage, or if your home is several stories.
