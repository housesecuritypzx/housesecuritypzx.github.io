<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
