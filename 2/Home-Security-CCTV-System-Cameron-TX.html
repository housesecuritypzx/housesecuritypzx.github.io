<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The creative bit is that the camera not just identifies that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to automatically understand.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
