When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
