<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and really indirectly secures information by preventing it from being transferred. The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the malicious assailant to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.

The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my husband).
