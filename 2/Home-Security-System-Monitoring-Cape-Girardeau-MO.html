<p>Most video catches images in the natural light or infrared spectrums. Thermal cameras can also catch video of a person's movements based on body temperature level.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer numerous "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies cast doubt on the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or four totally free incorrect alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>

However, wise alarms do require a hub that permits the various components to wirelessly link. However for many wise alarms this center can be put throughout your home.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
