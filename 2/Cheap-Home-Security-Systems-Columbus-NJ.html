<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
