Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they used to be. Nevertheless, they are still based on disturbance and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is secured.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about 2 minutes before it even noticed I existed. </p>
