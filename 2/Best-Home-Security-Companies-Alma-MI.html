<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
