<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement.
