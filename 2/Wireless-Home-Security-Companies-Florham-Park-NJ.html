<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little a problem is between detecting and recording motion.

If a dubious lawbreaker was fast enough, they could get past the camera before it had time to record them.</p>
<p>Smart devices, laptop computers, tablets and other devices have driven this growth, and due to the fact that of how expensive information strategies are, the majority of people select to connect their device to wireless Internet connections.
