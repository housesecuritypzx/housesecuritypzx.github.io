Expect to pay an additional Nest Aware fee for each camera you install, consisting of the Nest Hey there doorbell. Monitoring is supplied by Brinks Home Security however doesn't consist of fire service with the Nest Protect. And although we value geofencing, we had numerous mistakes with that feature during testing.</p>

If this is a high top priority, make sure to look into the company's features or talk to a representative directly.
