<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
