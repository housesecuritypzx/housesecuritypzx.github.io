<h2>There Are Many Video Surveillance Camera Options Cleves</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of several cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.
