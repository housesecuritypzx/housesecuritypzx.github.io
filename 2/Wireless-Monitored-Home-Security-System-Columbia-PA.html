<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
