<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
