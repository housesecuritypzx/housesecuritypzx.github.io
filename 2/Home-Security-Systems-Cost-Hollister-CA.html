In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera spots motion or sound.

For instance, if somebody opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which occurs to be the loudest of the 3 sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro identifies a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on. Sadly, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not whatever works as it should; nevertheless, the capacity is still there.</p>
