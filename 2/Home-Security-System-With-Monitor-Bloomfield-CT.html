<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
