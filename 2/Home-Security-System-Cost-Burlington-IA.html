<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
