<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In fact, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and a person, for instance, allows you to cut down on unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
