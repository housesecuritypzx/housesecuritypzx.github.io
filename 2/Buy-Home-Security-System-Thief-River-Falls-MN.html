<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a bit of an issue is in between finding and taping movement. Because the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it spots motion. They might get past the camera before it had time to record them if a dubious criminal was quickly enough.</p>

You can likewise work with a 3rd party service to monitor the video surveillance systems and handle the notifies. These companies have the ability to receive activity informs and evaluate the scenario remotely.</p>
