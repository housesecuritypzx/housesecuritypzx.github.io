<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious opponent, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of data and really indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the malicious opponent to tape-record these codes and use different breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>
