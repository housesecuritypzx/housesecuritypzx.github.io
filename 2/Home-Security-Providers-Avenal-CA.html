<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set amount of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement.

And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you want.</p>
