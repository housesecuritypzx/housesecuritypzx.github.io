<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
