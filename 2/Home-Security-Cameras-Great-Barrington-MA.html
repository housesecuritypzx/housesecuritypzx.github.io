<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present recommendation.</p>
