<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the destructive attacker to record these codes and utilize different splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>
