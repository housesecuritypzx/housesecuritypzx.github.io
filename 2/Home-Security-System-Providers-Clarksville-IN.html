<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens may breach local sound control laws, so inspect ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Some Ring users have reported security breaches in their devices that enable bad actors to use the two-way communication and see the video feed. In a statement to SafeWise, Ring noted that these breaches can be avoided by using strong, special passwords, allowing two-factor authentication, altering passwords regularly, and including authorized users rather of sharing credentials. </p>
