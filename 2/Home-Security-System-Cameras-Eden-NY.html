This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four white and sleek bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The most significant, baddest function is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you incredibly crisp, clear video that lets you focus on details like faces and license plates without ruining your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Webcam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it happens, is directly connected now on Amazon's security homepage, however to be clear, the offering is not exclusive to Lennar property owners. </p>
