<p>The huge perk is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that does not look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it rarely sends incorrect informs because it tracks your phone (and other family member's phones), so understands when you're at home and turns everything off.
