So if Amazon hopes to eat up some of that market, it needs to offer something equivalent.

Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>

Vivint deals a no-contract option where you can acquire your equipment upfront or a contract choice where the cost of the equipment is spread over the duration of the contract.
