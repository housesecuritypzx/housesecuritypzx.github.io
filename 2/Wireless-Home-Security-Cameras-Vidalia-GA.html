<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The Ring Stick Up Camera comes in wired and battery versions, which can be utilized inside your home and outdoors. But neither can tape-record continually, and they both require the Ring Protect plan to record recordings.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.
