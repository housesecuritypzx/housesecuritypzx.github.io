<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse.

To hold and recoup costs alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to necessitate authorities reaction.</p>
