<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more budget friendly memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is an expensive security camera, however we think it deserves the investment.

Many sites needing alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
