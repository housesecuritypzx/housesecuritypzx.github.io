<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years. However if you might upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
