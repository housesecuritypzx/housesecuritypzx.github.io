<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so crucial?  For beginners, Deep Knowing permits someone to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the components you are searching for in the recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective service for gathering and catching wrongdoers proof.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm however you remain in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get alerted up until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise may scare off would-be trespassers-- if you're lucky. However the authorities won't come up until you personally call them. </p>
