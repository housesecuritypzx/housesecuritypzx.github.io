We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
