Unlike Nest, TP-Link does not make you sign up for a function plan to get the most out of the Kasa Webcam Outdoor. By just purchasing the camera, you already get things like customized activity zones, and TP-Link is relatively generous with its complimentary cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history).</p>

<p>We like all the features the Kasa Area provides that make it such outstanding worth and one of the very best security cameras on the marketplace: two-way audio, night vision, 1080p HD recording, customized activity zones and more. The camera can tape-record video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly great on a smartphone screen and won't tax your internet connection too much. Netatmo also enables you to fine tune the settings for each individual user - for instance, don't tape Abbie, but do record Ben. It's in fact quite wise.</p>
