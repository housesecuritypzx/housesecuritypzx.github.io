<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded.

This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend on just how much cloud storage you are willing to spend for.</p>
