<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. Numerous cities also need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
