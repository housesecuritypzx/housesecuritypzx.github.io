<p>On the surface, these 2 camera classifications might appear similar, though if you were able to see within, the differences end up being distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are created and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being missing or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.
