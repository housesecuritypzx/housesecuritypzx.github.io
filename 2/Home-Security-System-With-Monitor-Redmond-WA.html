<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be applied as a credit to charges due on the following month's costs from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used instead to any other charges due on your bill for Comcast services. You will not receive a cash or credit card refund of your pre-payment. Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under relevant law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by appropriate law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without restriction, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, altered or not returned).</p>
