<h2>A Better Tool For Monitoring And Ensuring Hand Hygiene Adherence Talladega</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later.
