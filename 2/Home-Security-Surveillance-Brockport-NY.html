We serve both residential and commercial customers throughout Southern California. On its face, video surveillance technology is already pervasive. However beyond the personal privacy issues of police's widespread access to historic and real-time video footage lies the hazard of it being accessed by destructive hackers.

<h3>New House Alarm System Brockport NY 14420</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.
