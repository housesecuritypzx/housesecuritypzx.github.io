To get the very best and brightest night view, consider a camera with infrared (IR) innovation to sending intense light through wavelengths. The number of infrared LEDs used in a camera determines how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to clearly reveal what's outside your home. Search for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or much better of night vision.

It can't send notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
