Wireless alarms are likewise perfect for occupants, as they can take the system with them when they move. Property owners, on the other hand, have a much greater degree of choice.

Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
