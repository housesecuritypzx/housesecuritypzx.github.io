And that's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>IP (Web protocol) cameras carry out the same functions as their analog equivalents, however with vastly higher abilities. IP cameras boast sharper, greater resolution images and more flexible functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also provide you the choice to view video footage on a web browser.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION).
