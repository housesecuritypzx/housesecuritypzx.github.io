<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its pledge of up to one year of battery life.

<h3>Residential Alarm Companies in Passaic NJ</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
