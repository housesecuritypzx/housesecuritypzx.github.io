If you cancel early-- and some require 100%, a lot of home security companies will charge you around 75% of the remaining term of your agreement.</p>
<p>This also depends upon the provider, but you can expect signing a contract with suppliers who need expert installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some contracts might span up to 60 months or 5 years.
