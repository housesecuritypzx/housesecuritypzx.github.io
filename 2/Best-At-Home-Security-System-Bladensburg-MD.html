<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm ought to be enough to frighten trespassers in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to call for police response.</p>
