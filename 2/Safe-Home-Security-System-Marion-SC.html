<p>While every homeowner frets about burglaries, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. Innovation integration is one Vivint's strong suits. The company's remarkable mobile app has been highly ranked by users on both Google Play and the App Shop. It permits consumers to inspect live video feed, deactivate and activate security systems, and manage their automated home systems including wise locks, the Philips Shade system, and Nest and Aspect thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally do not included upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
