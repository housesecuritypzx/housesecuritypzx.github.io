Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
