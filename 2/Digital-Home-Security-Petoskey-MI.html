Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be. However, they are still subject to interference and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is secured.</p>
<p>However, convenience does not necessarily feature included security. If you don't do it right, going from wired to wireless security implies possibly exposing yourself to outside attacks. You do not need to enter a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, warns Du. Without taking the proper security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home open up to intruders who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors getting their existence.</p>
<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera links straight to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a cool service, or at least one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, but we can't help but feel it's also the factor for the Swann's somewhat sluggish reaction times.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
