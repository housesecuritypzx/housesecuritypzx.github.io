<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite.
