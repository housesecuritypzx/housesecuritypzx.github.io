<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment rates is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
