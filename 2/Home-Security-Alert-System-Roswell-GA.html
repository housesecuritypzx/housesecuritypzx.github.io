They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your home. If you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the team will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring.
