<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year contract, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll stay put for at least 3 years, opt for the agreement and enjoy those cost savings. But if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>

Although FrontPoint uses a variety of equipment and home automation products at a sensible price, the one location where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
