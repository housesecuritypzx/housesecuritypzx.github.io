<p>Firstly, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of night, use and day images have constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and cars and trucks.</p>

<p>The majority of monitoring companies will first connect to you so that they can know if the alarm was real or if it was an accident. If you do not react or you say that it wasn't an accident, the alarm monitoring company will alert the authorities right away. Different parts of your system will set off different parts of the alarm, which informs the monitoring company what you require - paramedics, firefighters, or authorities.</p>
