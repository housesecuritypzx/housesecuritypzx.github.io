<h3>In Home Alarm System Chelsea AL 35043</h3>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a very wide location, and you can dim them by means of its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or patio for a party.

When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
