<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the 3rd generation of the celebrated Dropcam-- one of the very first, and one of the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be set up almost anywhere inside your home.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; whatever within their focus capability is recorded.

However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you require to add to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
