<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a licensed electrical contractor (who takes place to be my husband).
