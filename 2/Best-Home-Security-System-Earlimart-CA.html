So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since apparently they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
