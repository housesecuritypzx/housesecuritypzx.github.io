<p>The Ring Floodlight Web cam combines two vital gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera detects motion, it turns on its two effective LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends alerts directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection.
