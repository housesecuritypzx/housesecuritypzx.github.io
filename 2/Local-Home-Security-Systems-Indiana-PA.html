<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
