<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was fairly pleased. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being viewed understand they're being enjoyed, and you can pick to record video or images and save them to your smart gadget on an impulse. </p>
