<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
