<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
