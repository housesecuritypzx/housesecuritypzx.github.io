<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was identified. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
