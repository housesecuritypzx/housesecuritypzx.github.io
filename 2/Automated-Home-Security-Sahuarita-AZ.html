<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
