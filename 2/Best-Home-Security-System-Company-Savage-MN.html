<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
