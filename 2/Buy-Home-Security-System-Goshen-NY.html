Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
