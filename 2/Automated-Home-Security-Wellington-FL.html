<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
