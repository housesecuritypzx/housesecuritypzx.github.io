<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
