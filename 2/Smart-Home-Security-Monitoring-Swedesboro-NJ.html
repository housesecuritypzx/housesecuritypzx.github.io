<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
