<p>Because the glass real estate doesn't get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in capabilities.

Monitored alarm: These systems connect the alarm to a monitoring company that has the ability to call the cops or fire department if a disruption is spotted.
