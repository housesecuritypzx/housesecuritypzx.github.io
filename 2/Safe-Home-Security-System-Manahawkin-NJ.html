<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
