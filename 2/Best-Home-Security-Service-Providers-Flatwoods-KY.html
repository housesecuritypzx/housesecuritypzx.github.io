<p>Another essential subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
