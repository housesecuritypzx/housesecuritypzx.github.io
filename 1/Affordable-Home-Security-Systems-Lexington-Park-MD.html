We likewise found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
