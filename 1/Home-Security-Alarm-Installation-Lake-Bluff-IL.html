We also like that the Kasa Web cam Outdoor won't break the bank (it costs $88.16 at the time of writing), and it's super simple to install. Buying multiple Arlo Pro 2's can get pricey.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The biggest, baddest function is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which gives you extremely crisp, clear video that lets you focus on details like faces and license plates without screwing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Cam delivers higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it takes place, is directly linked now on Amazon's security homepage, however to be clear, the offering is not special to Lennar property owners. </p>
