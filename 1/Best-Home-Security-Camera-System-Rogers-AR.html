The scientists looked for CCTV assessments released between 2007 and 2017 to account for the duration since the last evaluation (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier). Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading researchers to ask about upcoming assessments. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
