<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Furthermore they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video.
