<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
