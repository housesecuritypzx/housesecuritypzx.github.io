<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

The camera includes functions like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, however it does not take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions found on most surveillance cameras. </p>
