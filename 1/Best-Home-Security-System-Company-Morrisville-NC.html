<p>When picking a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other significant choice. Outdoor cameras will often be built to be more durable and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

Due to the fact that items are seldom precisely the exact same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
