<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home.

We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
