<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
