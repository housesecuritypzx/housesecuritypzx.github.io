<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some methods, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer support experience differs commonly depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
