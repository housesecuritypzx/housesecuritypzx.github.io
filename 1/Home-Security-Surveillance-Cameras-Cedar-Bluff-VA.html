<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
