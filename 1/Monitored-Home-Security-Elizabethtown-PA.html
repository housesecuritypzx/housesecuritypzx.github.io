Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

For a $10 minimum (or $100 for the whole year), you can receive custom motion alerts, live views from your Ring camera, video recording for approximately 60 days, and professional monitoring.
