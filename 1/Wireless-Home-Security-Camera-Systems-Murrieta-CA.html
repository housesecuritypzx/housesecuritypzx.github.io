<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current suggestion.</p>
