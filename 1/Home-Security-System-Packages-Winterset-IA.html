<p>Thank you guys for the assistance, what terrific consumer servcie you provide. I purchased a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am quite helpful to install it myself.

<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies offer heavily discounted or totally free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible.

All things considered, residence Beginner Kit is among the best self monitored alarm for those who desire a simple and bare-bones alarm. Nevertheless, the absence of a camera is a major oversight and they need to update their clever home integration systems.</p>
