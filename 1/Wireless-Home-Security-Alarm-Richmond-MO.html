<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
