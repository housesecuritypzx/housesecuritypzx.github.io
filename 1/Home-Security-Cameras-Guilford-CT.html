<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get totally included, professional-grade security solutions that are simple to install and basic to use. Wireless Security Systems utilize local hard drive, cloud storage, or a mix of the 2 in place of videotape video footage made use of by landline systems. Ring video security cameras are high definition, but they are set to tape-record just when motion is detected. This puts less need on your home Wi-Fi service compared to popular competitors like Nest Secure that record continuously.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed central monitoring station. All of the cameras in a provided system require a main video recorder in order to send and archive the footage they are capturing.
