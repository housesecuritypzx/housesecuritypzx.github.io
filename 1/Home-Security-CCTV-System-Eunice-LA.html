<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a learning period).
