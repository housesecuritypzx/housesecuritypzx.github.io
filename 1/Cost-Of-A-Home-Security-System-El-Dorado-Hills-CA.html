<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
