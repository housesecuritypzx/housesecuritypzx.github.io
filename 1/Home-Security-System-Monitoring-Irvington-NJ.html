Modern systems now have extraordinary capabilities", though these have actually produced reasonable misgivings about the risk for personal privacy and potential abuse such capabilities create.

<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with fixed lens are normally smaller sized than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most remarkable response time of all home security companies we evaluated.
