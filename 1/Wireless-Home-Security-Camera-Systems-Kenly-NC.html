<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment prices is super sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
