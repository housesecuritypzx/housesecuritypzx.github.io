<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smart device notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
