<p>Now I explained this appeared like a stretch considering previous Sims games had burglars, but my buddy explained the Sims 4 was made for a new generation, with a team of producers surrounded by individuals OF that generation who would explain that the invasion of their home or safe location might create feelings of pain or possible even activating. Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing games for a very long time and a lot of the stuff in earlier video games I've played a years back would certainly NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>
