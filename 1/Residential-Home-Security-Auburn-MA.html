<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency situation. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to be enough to frighten trespassers most of the times. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to warrant police action.</p>
