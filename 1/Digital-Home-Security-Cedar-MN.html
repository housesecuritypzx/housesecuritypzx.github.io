<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
