<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
