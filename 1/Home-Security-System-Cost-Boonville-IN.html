<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
