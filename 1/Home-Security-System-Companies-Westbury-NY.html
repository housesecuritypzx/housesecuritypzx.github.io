When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
