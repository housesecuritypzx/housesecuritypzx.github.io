<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
