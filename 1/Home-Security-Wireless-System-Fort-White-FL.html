Normally you would find a PCB with numerous terminals or antennas for connections. Lots of likewise have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port. Some might have a serial port for connection to a service technician's computer system for diagnostics. These are the true heart of the system.

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific person comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to release a smart smoke alarm and siren later on this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is vital. In fact, we do not suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for example, enables you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
