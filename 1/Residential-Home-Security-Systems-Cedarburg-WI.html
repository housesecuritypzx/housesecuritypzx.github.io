<p>Throughout our research study we faced a couple of surprises. For one the vast bulk of home security system notifies to the authorities are incorrect alarms.

The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual comes to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.
