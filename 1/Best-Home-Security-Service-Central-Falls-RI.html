<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of technology. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you envision a home security camera. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This meant every windows and door required its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Just a couple decades ago, the home security market was dominated by a couple of huge names using costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.

<p>As you weigh your security choices, ensure you're not disregarding the security basics. Why bother getting that fancy alarm system if you consistently leave the front door unlocked and have such dim lighting that a camera can't tape-record a clear image anyhow?

<p>When installing cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you might wish to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are discreet and small, sometimes suited everyday objects such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets. If you need to record an important conference in a public location, a personal hidden camera constructed into a watch or pen might be a good option.

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had issues. The switch from daylight to night vision took about five minutes (though it worked fine switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes prior to it even noticed I existed. </p>
