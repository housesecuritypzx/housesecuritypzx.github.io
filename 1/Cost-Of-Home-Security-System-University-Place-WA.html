I am so delighted that you have mentioned about wise home integration Simply last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a property owner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. So we needed to buy new cameras.</p>

<p>Up until now so normal. Things begin to get truly fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera identifies an admit it does not acknowledge, it will send out an alert and picture to your phone, allowing you to give that person the twice. If it's somebody getting up to no good, the camera will follow their motions and conserve the timestamp, so you can easily find it in the future.

<p>For example, the bullet cameras with repaired lens are usually smaller sized than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most outstanding response time of all home security companies we examined. Their timeframe for response in under 10 seconds, which we should confess is rather exceptional. A note of value, if you wish to get the SimpliSafe app, then you would have to register for the more expensive monitoring plan.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, however it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It also suggests that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would be enough to send out even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
