So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since apparently they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
