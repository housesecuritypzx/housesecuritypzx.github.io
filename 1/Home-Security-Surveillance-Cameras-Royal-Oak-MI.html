<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey however is essential. In reality, we don't recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and a person, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary notifies.
