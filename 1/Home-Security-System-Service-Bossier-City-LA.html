<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
