<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
