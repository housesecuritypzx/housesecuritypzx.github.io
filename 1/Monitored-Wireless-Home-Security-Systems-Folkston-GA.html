I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, alerting authorities, or dispatching private security forces.
