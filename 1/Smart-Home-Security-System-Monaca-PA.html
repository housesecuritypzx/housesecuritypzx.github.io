<p>Video recording isn't a basic option on the majority of security systems.

Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a devoted storage drive that offers you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, that makes it simple to find a video occasion that occurred at a particular moment.</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
