<h3>Wireless Home Security Monitoring in Colorado</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life by far.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
