The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

We have actually seen it highlight vehicles, mice, and moths.</p>

Finally, iSmart has its own Amazon Alexa skill. Using the skill, you can arm the system, disarm it, or swap modes with your voice.</p>
