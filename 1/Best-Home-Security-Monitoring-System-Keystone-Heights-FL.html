<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a very wide location, and you can dim them via its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a celebration.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
