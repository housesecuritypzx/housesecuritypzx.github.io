<p>Submit a protection and the type 1 or ADT Specialist will call you, from time to time, about Protection 1, ADT and Lifeshield deals.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they automobile renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.

<p>Another location where Arlo stands out is customer service.
