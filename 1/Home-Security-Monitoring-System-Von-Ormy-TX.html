At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten intruders for the most part. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical evidence like camera video footage or a broken window to warrant authorities response.</p>
