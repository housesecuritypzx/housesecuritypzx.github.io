<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>The San Diego Authorities Department wished to gain access to video footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was filled with software application compatibility problems, and officers had problem seeing video in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.
