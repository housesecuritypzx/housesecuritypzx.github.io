<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring.
