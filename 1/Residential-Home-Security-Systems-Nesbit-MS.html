With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

Landline systems use traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
