<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and permits systems to be scaled up much more easily than can be made with DVR. To learn more on video recorders, see the area below. </p>
