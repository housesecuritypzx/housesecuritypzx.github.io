On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of clever home equipment from other companies.
