<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home.
