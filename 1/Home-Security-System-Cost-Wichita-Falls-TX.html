<h3>Outdoor Surveillance Camera in Wichita Falls TX</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
