<h3>Intrusion Alarm System Crestline OH 44827</h3>
<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
