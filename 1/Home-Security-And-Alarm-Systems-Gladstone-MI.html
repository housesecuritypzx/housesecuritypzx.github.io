<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
