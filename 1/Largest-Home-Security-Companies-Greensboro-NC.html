<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of an advantage called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to figure out whether alarm activity is a real emergency or false alarm. The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>

<p>The price of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
