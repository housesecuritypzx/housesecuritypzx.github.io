The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.
