<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems usually don't come with upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements!
