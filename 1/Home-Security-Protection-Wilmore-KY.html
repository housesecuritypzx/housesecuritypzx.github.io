<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensors.

Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
