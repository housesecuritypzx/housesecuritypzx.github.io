<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
