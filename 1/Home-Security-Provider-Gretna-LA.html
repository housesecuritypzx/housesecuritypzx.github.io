<p>The big reward is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that does not appear like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it hardly ever sends incorrect alerts because it tracks your phone (and other relative's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns whatever off.
