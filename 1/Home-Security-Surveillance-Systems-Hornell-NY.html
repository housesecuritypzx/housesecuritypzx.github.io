<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.

Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing video games for a very long time and a lot of the stuff in earlier games I've played a years back would definitely NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>
