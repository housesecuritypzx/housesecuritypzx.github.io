<p>From monitoring windows and doors, to making certain the swimming pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, and even securing the medicine in the bathroom cabinet - the sensors are small adequate to use special protection not offered with hard-wired alarm systems. When the camera observes motion within its field of view, cameras with motion detection can send you notifications.

It isn't really clever. Wireless devices interact more firmly and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>
