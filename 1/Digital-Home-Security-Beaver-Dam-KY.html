<p>From monitoring windows and doors, to making certain the swimming pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, and even securing the medicine in the bathroom cabinet - the sensors are small adequate to use special protection not offered with hard-wired alarm systems. When the camera observes motion within its field of view, cameras with motion detection can send you notifications.
