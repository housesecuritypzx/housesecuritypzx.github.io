<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of identifying tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on info about the temperature differences. Because things are seldom exactly the same temperature as other objects around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are believed to be most reliable, which usually consists of extremely populated towns, town hall, car parks, or different other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).
