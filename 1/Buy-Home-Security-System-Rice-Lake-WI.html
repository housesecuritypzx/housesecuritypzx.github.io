<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
