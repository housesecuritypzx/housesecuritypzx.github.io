<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) happens when a hacker is able to eavesdrop on network traffic and recognize the MAC address of a computer with network advantages Most wireless systems permit some type of MAC filtering to permit only authorized computer systems with particular MAC IDs to get and use the network.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assaulter, given that the interruption of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transferred. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the destructive attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
