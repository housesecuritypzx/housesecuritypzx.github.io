Lots of websites needing alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
