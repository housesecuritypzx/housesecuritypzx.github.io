<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

You can extend the quantity of days you manage buying a membership, but I do not think the majority of people will need that alternative.</p>
