Some systems save taped video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others offer cloud storage. Locally saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget, but you have to beware not to overwrite video you may need later. Cloud storage makes it easy to shop and access tape-recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars per year depending upon your subscription.

<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be an inexpensive choice for consumers in backwoods.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
