<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety.
