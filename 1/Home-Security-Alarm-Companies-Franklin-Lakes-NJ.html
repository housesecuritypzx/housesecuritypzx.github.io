<h3>Residential Burglar Alarms Franklin Lakes NJ 07417</h3>
<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; whatever within their focus capability is recorded. That is to say, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it pertains to separating the images of an active occurrence about to occur. However you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to add to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
