<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
