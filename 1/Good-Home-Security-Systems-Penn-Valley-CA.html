<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt performance.</p>
