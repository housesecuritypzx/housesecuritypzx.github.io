The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of night, use and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home.
