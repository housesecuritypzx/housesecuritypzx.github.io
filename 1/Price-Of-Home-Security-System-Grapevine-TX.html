The typical length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts could cover approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would advise considering a DIY home security system rather if you want to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>

You can install a complete system with break-in, fire, carbon monoxide, water and freeze sensing units in about 2 hours, without fishing a single wire.
