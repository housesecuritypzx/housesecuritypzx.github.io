As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
