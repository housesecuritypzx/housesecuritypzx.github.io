<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
