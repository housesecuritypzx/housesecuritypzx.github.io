You need to log into the web browser to set them all up, so you can control them via the app in the future.

<p>Nest Secure provides loads of clever gadgetry-- a lot so that you might get overwhelmed by all of the options. However hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect absolutely nothing less!

Some companies produce and sell their own exclusive equipment, while others rely on third-party products. Particular home security systems need expert installation.
