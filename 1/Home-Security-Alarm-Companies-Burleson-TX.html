<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
