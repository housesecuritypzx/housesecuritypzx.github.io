<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the best tools for watching over your home. Its wire-free style, high-resolution video, and economical cloud monitoring help it stand above the competitors. Still, it's one of the most pricey security cameras you can buy, so we think the Wyze Cam Pan is a good option if you're intending to conserve some dough.
