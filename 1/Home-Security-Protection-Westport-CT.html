However considering that the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some extra money while giving a client change, for example), we think it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the proof you require.

<p>How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware.

<p>When you aren't around, many robbers enter your home or business. The come throughout the day, when you're most likely to be at work or running errands.
