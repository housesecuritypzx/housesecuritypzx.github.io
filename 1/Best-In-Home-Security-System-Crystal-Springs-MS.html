<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
