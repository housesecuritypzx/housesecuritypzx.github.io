The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
