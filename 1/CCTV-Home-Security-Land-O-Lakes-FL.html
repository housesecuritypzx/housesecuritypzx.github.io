<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of spotting small differences in temperature. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that things are seldom exactly the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
