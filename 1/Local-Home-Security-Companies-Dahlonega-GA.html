These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment in advance supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as many times as you want.</p>
