This usually involves finding an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
