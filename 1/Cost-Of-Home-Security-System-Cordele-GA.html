<h3>Security System Companies in Cordele GA</h3>
<p>During our research study we encountered a couple of surprises. For one the large bulk of home security system signals to the authorities are false alarms.

<p>IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an ingrained video server having an IP address, capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio).

What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in perfect conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific situations such as baby-sitter web cams or checking in on a pet, though when seeking to gather evidence of a criminal activity they often come up short.</p>
<p>Since they work using a digital signal which can be conserved directly to a computer, these cameras do not require a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of image needed or wanted). The greatest image quality of DVD is only slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
