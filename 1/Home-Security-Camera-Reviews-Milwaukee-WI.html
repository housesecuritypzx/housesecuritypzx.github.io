Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

When they find motion, the alarm is activated and other security devices (such as a camera) may be activated.
