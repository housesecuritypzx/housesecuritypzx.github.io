Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
