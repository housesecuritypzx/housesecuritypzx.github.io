<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though.

Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
