<p>Unmonitored alarm systems: These alarms develop a loud noise that is audible both within and outside the home. While they might terrify a burglar away, the drawback is that no one will be called to come to your home, and you will need to call emergency situation services yourself. Nevertheless, alarm pros say having an unmonitored system is still much better than having no security system at all.</p>
<p>When purchasing a system online, know that most of the time professional alarm companies will not install customer bought products! Why? Alarm companies do not understand if the bought products are used, do not work, or have compatibility problems.

Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive option. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end.
