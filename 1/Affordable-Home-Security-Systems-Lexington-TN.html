<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>The frequency of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) service has actually risen in recent years. Although local storage is effective in its own respect, it has numerous caveats.

<p>The bright side is that the WPA3 is currently here and will replace WPA2. The Wi-Fi Alliance recently announced its next-generation wireless network security standard which aims to fix a common security concern: open Wi-Fi networks. More than that, it features security improvements and consists of a suite of functions to simplify Wi-fi security setup for users and provider.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
