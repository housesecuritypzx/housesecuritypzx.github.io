<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole family will love. Expert installation with professional monitoring: Brands like Vivint and ADT expertly install and monitor your system-- you don't need to babysit or raise a finger signals. Over my 25 plus year profession in the security market, I have investigated, offered, set up, and due to the fact that we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I would like to admit.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally don't featured upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
