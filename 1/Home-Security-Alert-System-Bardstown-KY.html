<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for recording a burglar in the act, though. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
