<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
