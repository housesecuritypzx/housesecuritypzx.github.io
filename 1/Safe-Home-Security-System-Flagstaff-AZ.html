The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

Likewise, when an automatic dialer alarm is tripped, a telephone call is immediately put to the authorities or fire departments, and a pre-recorded statement is played when that call is addressed. Automatic dialer alarms are not allowed to dial 9-1-1.</p>
