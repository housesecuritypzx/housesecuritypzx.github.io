<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same method as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!

If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise might scare off would-be burglars-- if you're lucky. But the police won't come till you personally call them. </p>
