<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide array of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one area where the company particularly excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
