<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Without seeing the live feed all the time, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative actual time. Depending upon the camera, it may send text alerts when it identifies motion, noise, a face (unacknowledged or recognized), or all 3. Some can send out notifies to multiple people, usually anyone else in the household using that product's app; others will send emails in addition to text as a failsafe in case you can't access your mobile phone. </p>
