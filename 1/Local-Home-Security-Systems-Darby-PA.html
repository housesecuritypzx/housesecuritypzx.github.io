According to a report released by the Urban Institute, authorities departments nationwide react to millions of incorrect alarms from resident and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is trustworthy and simple to utilize, but costly and wacky unless you want the convenience of a professional install and maintenance.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

As such, if there's a false alarm, you'll have to handle the local emergency situation group and spend a long time discussing the incorrect alarm.</p>
<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That person at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, however it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
