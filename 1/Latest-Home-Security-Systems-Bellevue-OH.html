<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
