<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease crime. Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording unit, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - particularly if your home has already been built - so be sure to seek advice from an expert before handling the job yourself. Wired home security cameras send information through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're likewise not prone to interference such as cellular and radio frequencies. If you have a big home or home that requires thorough protection, wired systems are a better alternative since they can support more cameras.</p>
